2.  adding buttons to the grid layout
3.  removing the source from images to make it appear invisible
4.  using a single onClick method for multiple buttons by utilizing the "view"  variable
5.  using tags on each image to keep track of the images.
6.  using random number generators to generate question and answer options.  
7.  resetting the app every time user wants to play again.
8.  using animations in the app.
9.  adding music and sound effects to the app
10. implementing a score sheet that keeps tracks of questions that were correct and incorrect, as well as the highest number of
    questions have gotten correct
11. utilizing a timer to set the game for 30 seconds only.
